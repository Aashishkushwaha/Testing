why?

// Answer =>

/*
  Resetting the CSS ->
  Resetting the CSS means removing all the styles which is bydefault provided by the user agent (browsers).
  Resetting the CSS is helpful technique when you want to apply the customized style to you webpages.
  Resetting css says that we don’t need the browsers’ default styles at all. 
  Whatever styles we need, we’ll define in the project according to our needs. 

  Normalizing CSS ->
  Each browser applies some default setting to the HTML element (by default).
  Normalising the CSS means eliminating the differece between the styles applied by differnt user agents (browsers).
  Normalize.css is a small CSS file that provides cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.
  e.g. Normalize.css is used to normalize the css.


  My opinion ->
  While developing a webpage I use the combination of the 'Normalizing the CSS' with some amount of 'CSS Resets'.
